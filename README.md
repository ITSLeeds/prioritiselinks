# Prioritise links

The purpose of this repository is to create a standardised method that
can be used to prioritise the links within a cycle route network that
have the greatest need for new cycle infrastructure. This prioritisation
is based on two segment-level attributes - cycling potential and the
existing quality of cycle provision.

Cycling potential could relate to current or future modelled cycling
levels. Existing quality of cycle provision is assessed using the
CycleStreets quietness metric, which is a measurement of ‘cycle
friendliness.’
